1) The store makes a good profit of $175K on $1.57M in Sales, but this comes from selling a low number of items (22K). This shows success is based on selling expensive or high-profit products, not a large quantity of cheap ones. 
2) Technology is the top part of the business, bringing in the most money and profit, with popular items being Phones and Chairs, showing where the main focus and profit come from. 
3) Customers strongly prefer to pay digitally, with Card payments making up the biggest part of sales revenue at 35.38% ($553.99K), making it much more common than using Cash on Delivery (COD).
4) Sales are getting much better each year, especially at the end of the year (October, November, and December). The sales line for 2020 is clearly above 2019's, proving the business is growing quickly during the holiday season.
5) Most people choose the cheaper shipping options, like Standard Class and Second Class, which bring in most of the sales revenue, meaning customers generally don't want to pay extra for the fastest delivery like First Class or Same Day.
